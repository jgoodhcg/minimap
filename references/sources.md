# Sources

Evidence behind the instruction-design rules (`[BP-INSTR]`) and the verifiability
rules (`[BP-VERIFY]`). Load this file only when you write or revise those rules.
Rules cite it by number. Rationale stays here so it does not consume the
instruction stream (`BP-INSTR-08`).

Peer-review status is marked where it matters. Treat a working paper as weaker
evidence than a published one.

## Cognitive surrender and overreliance

- `[20]` Shaw & Nave. "Thinking — Fast, Slow, and Artificial: How AI is Reshaping
  Human Reasoning and the Rise of Cognitive Surrender." Wharton School Research
  Paper, SSRN, 2026. **Working paper, not peer reviewed.** N=1,372 across three
  experiments and 9,593 trials. Correct AI advice raised accuracy from 46% to
  71%. Faulty AI advice dropped it to 31%. Participants followed incorrect
  advice 80% of the time. High general technology trust predicted vulnerability.
  High need for cognition and higher fluid intelligence predicted resistance.
  Coined the term.

  Functions Can Reduce Overreliance on AI in AI-assisted Decision-making."
  Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact. 5, CSCW1, 2021. arXiv:2102.09692. N=199.
  Cognitive forcing cut overreliance below simple explainable-AI designs.
  Participants rated the most effective designs least favorably. Benefits
  concentrated in participants high in need for cognition.

  During Decision-Making." Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact. 7, CSCW1, Article
  129, 2023. arXiv:2212.06823. Five studies, N=731. Overreliance follows a
  cost-benefit rule. An explanation reduces overreliance when it lowers the cost
  to verify the output.

  critical thinking. Self-confidence correlated with more.
